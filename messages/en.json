        "intro": "Hello, I am Jes√∫s Olmos, a developer specialized in Next.js, passionate about technology, logic, and problem-solving. My approach goes beyond writing code: I am fascinated by building efficient, scalable, and well-structured solutions where every line has a clear purpose. My journey in development is not limited to JavaScript and TypeScript; Rust is another of my great passions, a language that has taught me the value of performance, security, and efficient resource management. I enjoy exploring new technologies, optimizing systems, and tackling challenges that require logical and structured thinking. Here you will find some of my projects, where I combine modern architectures, performance, and best practices, always striving to create solid and efficient experiences.",
